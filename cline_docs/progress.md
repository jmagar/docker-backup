# Progress

**What Works:**
- Core backup functionality implemented in Go (`backup-tool` binary).
- Configuration loading via flags, environment variables, and `config.yaml` (using Viper). **Fixed issues loading boolean/slice types (Climb bU6G)**.
- Discovery of projects and their associated compose files (`*.y*ml`).
- Execution of `docker compose` commands (down, ps, pull, up) with basic v1/v2 detection, using detected command path.
- **Volume Parsing:** Reliably identifies host paths using `docker compose config` (using detected command path), handling variable substitution and complex syntax. **Fixed missing appdata bug (Climb aP9C)**.
- **Backup Creation:** Creates structured, timestamped zip archives containing both `compose/` and `appdata/` directories.
- **Exclusion Handling:** Correctly excludes files and directories based on glob patterns (`exclude` config). Handles `dir/**` and `**/*` patterns. **Fixed exclusion logic bug (Climb hY1D)**.
- Optional restarting of stacks (`restart_after_backup`) after successful backup.
- Optional pulling of latest images (`pull_before_restart`) before restart.
- Optional transfer of backup zip files via `rsync`.
- Dependency checks for external commands (`docker compose`/`docker-compose`, `rsync`).
- Reasonably robust error handling (logs errors per project, attempts to continue, handles permissions on excluded files).
- **Enhanced Logging (Climb lG8r):**
    - Centralized logging via `internal/logutil`.
    - Colorized console output (Info, Warn, Error, Success, Debug) with TTY detection.
    - Simultaneous file logging (`--log-file`, env var, config key).
    - Custom 12-hour timestamp format `[YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS AM/PM]` in log file.
    - Configurable log rotation (`lumberjack`).
    - `--verbose` flag controls debug level output.
    - Fixed panic related to logging during config load.
- Automatic cleanup of temporary directories.
- `README.md` updated with logging features, `config.example.yaml`, `.env.example` exist.
- Code formatting (`go fmt`) applied.
- Binary built (`backup-tool`).
- **Comprehensive Test Environment (`test-env/`)**: Successfully used to validate core functionality and bug fixes (A-K test cases).

**What's Left / Next Steps:**
- **Testing:** Thorough manual testing of logging features (rotation, precedence, TTY detection) is needed.
- **Refinement:** 
    - Consider adding `logutil.ProjectHeader` function for better log structure.
    - Review error handling consistency.
- **Documentation:** Final review of `README.md` after testing.
- **Future Enhancements (Deferred - Potential New Climbs):**
    - Direct Docker API integration (remove external command dependency).
    - Restore functionality.
    - Advanced incremental backup options.
    - More sophisticated volume handling (e.g., named volumes).

**Overall Status:**
Core functionality is implemented and major bugs related to configuration, appdata inclusion, and exclusions have been fixed through iterative testing. Logging has been significantly enhanced (Climb lG8r). The tool requires testing of the new logging features before further development.
